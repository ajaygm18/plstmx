# GPU Configuration Fix

## Problem
The application was encountering a RuntimeError when running on GPU-enabled devices:
```
RuntimeError: Physical devices cannot be modified after being initialized
```

This error occurred because TensorFlow was being imported and initialized in various modules before GPU memory growth could be configured, and TensorFlow doesn't allow GPU configuration changes after initialization.

## Solution
Implemented a centralized GPU configuration system that ensures GPU settings are applied before any TensorFlow operations:

### New Module: `utils/gpu_config.py`
- Centralized GPU configuration management
- Sets `TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=true` environment variable
- Configures GPU memory growth before TensorFlow initialization
- Graceful handling of already-initialized TensorFlow
- Proper error handling and logging

### Updated Entry Points
All main scripts now configure GPU settings at the very beginning:
- `run_extended_training.py`
- `run_maximum_accuracy_training.py` 
- `run_complete_training.py`
- `app.py`
- `models/plstm_tal.py`

### Removed Problematic Code
Replaced late GPU configuration calls in:
- `utils/bayesian_optimization.py` (line 426)
- `training/trainer.py` (line 80)

## Usage
The fix is automatically applied when importing any module. For manual control:

```python
from utils.gpu_config import ensure_gpu_configured
ensure_gpu_configured()
```

## Verification
The fix has been tested with comprehensive test suites:
- `test_gpu_simple.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_runtime_error_fix.py` - Simulates the original error scenario
- `test_gpu_config.py` - Full unit test suite

## Result
The RuntimeError "Physical devices cannot be modified after being initialized" is now resolved, and GPU memory growth is properly configured for training sessions.
